The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Program Overview

WJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities. Separately, the programme also supports selected states on localized strategies for testing scale up and equitable access, stronger engagement with the private sector, improved treatment readiness, robust awareness campaigns and capacity building initiatives, and analytics-based programme management.

Role

We are seeking a highly motivated individual with excellent analytical ability and strong communication skills for the role of State Program Officer (SPO). The SPO will input to the Engagement Lead and will be expected to develop and manage strong relationships with the State Department of Health to support program implementation initiatives. The role will require the SPO to help design, monitor and drive implementation of evidence-based COVID-19 strategies. The ideal candidate must have strong quantitative and analytical skills, excellent communication and written skills, be self-directed, be able to adapt to the differing needs of the program and have a strong commitment to excellence.

A strong profile will include outstanding credentials, analytical ability, and communication skills. The candidate must be self-driven, entrepreneurial, adaptable, and have a high level of comfort with ambiguity. The SPO must be able to function independently and flexibly with a strong commitment to excellence. We place great value on qualities such as resourcefulness, responsibility, tenacity, independence, energy, and work ethic.
Responsibilities:
Key responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
Support Department of Health (DoH) in all aspects of strategy and planning and implementation, ensuring ongoing alignment with the DoH strategic goals and priorities for COVID-19
Translate objectives provided by the national and state departments, donors, and other partner organizations into clear activity plans, and DoH on prioritization of initiatives;

Work with CHAI's technical teams and Program Manager(s) to develop and implement a coordinated program of support;

Perform other responsibilities as requested by programme leadership.
Qualifications:

Imagine that you’re an orchestrator, aligning with numerous programs to optimize employee productivity; coordinating with training and talent acquisition to forecast and manage staffing needs; and collaborating with IT to customize information systems - to help supervise fiscal activities within your team. You will monitor the accuracy of billing procedures for all clients within the site; identify strategies to improve campaign processes and opportunities to increase profitability. As you tackle your new tasks for the day, you know that it will lead to one thing: you must be effective in driving staffing forecasts that are best for our people and our business.
As a Workforce Planner, you will coordinate with operations, clients, and client services to be able to gather all the relevant data related to forecasting and calculation of program requirements. Along with this, you will be in charge of maintaining a roster of staff with accurate employee details which includes availability, preferences and skills.
What else? You will publish over/under snapshots, and create action plans that would either address any staffing gaps or minimize overages. You will be responsible for inputs in the online capacity plan tool in ensuring that the seating plan is accurate and adequate to meet operational needs.
So, do you have what it takes to become a Workforce Planner?
Requirement
Here’s what we’re looking for: We are looking for someone with BPO Operations background and at least 2 years of experience in Workforce Planning - preferably with expertise in Forecasting, Capacity Planning and Scheduling, and Real Time Management.
We need someone who has the ability to manage multiple, complex, ongoing tasks and projects. Someone who has a high attention to detail and has a strong desire to optimize procedures and processes. We’re in search for someone who is proactive when it comes to making decisions, as well as solving problems.
We need someone who is proficient in statistical analysis and possesses good computer and software skills. Someone who has the ability to read trends and project those into future forecasts. Someone who has a working knowledge of database applications such as MS Office (Excel, Outlook, Powerpoint), or the ability to learn technology very quickly.
Lastly, we’d be eager to speak to you if you have strong verbal and written communication skills; a high achiever and self-starter.

The position is based at ICRISAT- Patancheru, Hyderabad, within Markets, Institutions, Nutrition & Diversity Theme of Innovation systems for the Drylands Program and reports to Senior Scientist, Gender Research.

ICRISAT is a non-profit, non-political organization that conducts agricultural research for development in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with a wide array of partners throughout the world. ICRISAT and its partners help empower those living in the semi-arid tropics, especially smallholder farmers, to overcome poverty, hunger, malnutrition and a degraded environment through more efficient and profitable agriculture.

ICRISAT is headquartered in Patancheru near Hyderabad, India, with two regional hubs and five country offices in Sub-Saharan Africa. ICRISAT, established in 1972, is a member of the CGIAR Consortium. For more details, see www.icrisat.org.

Preamble
We are looking for an early career researcher or practitioner, who has strong gender, agriculture and natural resources knowledge, interested to work with leading gender experts to help bridge gender theory-policy-practice gaps

The CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) promotes a new paradigm, in which sustainably managed agricultural food systems are the key to healthy, functioning ecosystems and human well-being. To know more about, please visit www.wle.org.WLE is a research-for-development program delivering agriculture solutions that enhance natural resources and the well-being of people in the Global South

Applying a Gender Transformative Approach in WLE-LWS research at ICRISAT

ICRISAT under its WLE-LWS gender portfolio has an action plan for Impact: Gender-responsive Watershed Research. The plan is to making watershed research and interventions led by at ICRISAT more gender-responsive and eventually gender transformative. Gender-responsive approaches are designed to meet both women’s and men’s needs, priorities and constraints as a means to ensure a more equal spread of benefits, or at the very least, to ensure that research, programs and policy “do no harm” to marginalised and more vulnerable groups. While gender responsive projects address the symptoms of gender equality, gender transformative research 2 actively strives to examine, question and change the foundations of gender inequity and unequal power relations, with a focus on transforming gender relations to be more equitable. Our focus to build capacity internally will have direct outreach and impact on the multiple external stakeholders and partners who are engaged on the project. We also plan to build on the link established with Government of India’s Niti Aayog to influence key policy actors and program implementers on the need for gender responsive/transformative approaches that can structurally disrupt intersectional inequalities at scale in watershed management. The overarching goal is to create awareness and strengthen capacity at scale on the need for gender equal and socially inclusive watershed development and management, and influence policy change towards gender inclusive initiatives.

A GTA allows for tackling the root causes of inequality by gender, by understanding and addressing the structure and culture of power relations in policy and practice institutions at scale.

Tasks and Objectives
The Associate Scientist will be part of a Gender and Inclusion team at ICRISAT and CRP WLE, which supports WLE Flagships to applying a GTA approach. She/He will work under the supervision of the ICRISAT – WLE Gender and Inclusion focal point. He/she will also work closely with the team of researchers and consultants appointed for gender capacity strengthening of Flagship programs, to:

Assist in developing a gender analysis and synthesis paper of watershed research and development interventions and outcomes focusing on intersectional inequalities and social inclusion
Plan for and support two workshop aimed at internal capacity strengthening for relevant ICRISAT researchers, and an end of project advocacy and outreach workshop targeting external stakeholders and partners
Developing Gender responsive and transformative methodologies and toolkits for research and implementation
Work with the Communications team to translate WLE gender deliverables and outputs to communication outputs and outcomes as relevant to WLE reporting and outreach requirements,
Undertake and/or support relevant research, capacity strengthening and planning and documentation activities, as required
